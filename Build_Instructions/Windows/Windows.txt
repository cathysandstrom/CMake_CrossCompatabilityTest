Note: that these instructions assume you have successfully pulled the project from git
	  and have Visual Studio 15 2017 already installed on your machine. Other VS versions not garunteed.  

Windows Instructions (using Visual Studio 2017(VS-17)):
	1. 	Download and install the cmake gui from their website: 
			https://cmake.org/download/
	
	2. 	Open the folder containing the project from git, and create a new folder called 'build'
		- NOTE - add this folder to .gitignore if you change the name so it doesnt get pushed into the repo 
	
	3.	Open the CMake GUI which should be in your Start menu under Program Files or 
		the location you selected. Select the source code location to be the folder containing 
		the CMakeLists.txt file and the build the binaries path being the new build folder. 
			Where is the source code: 		${YOUR_PATH}/CMake_CrossCompatabilityTest
			Where to build the binaries: 	${YOUR_PATH}/CMake_CrossCompatabilityTest/build
	
	4.  Select the configure button on the bottom left. Select Visual Studio 15 2017 
		as the generator for the project. All other options are ok, so click Finish.
	
	5.  Once the program is done being configured, there should be options in red showing the new 
		configuration options generated. These settings haven't been applied yet, so you need to 
		select the button Generate to do this. 
		- NOTE - to change the generated settings and the generator, simply delete the new files 
				 generated in build folder, and go to the top right of the GUI and select 
				 'File>Delete Cache'. This will allow you to restart from step 4. 

	6. 	There should be new files inside of the build folder that are configured for a 
		Visual Studio 2017 project. Double click on the folder called CrossPlatformTutorial.sln
		to open the project in VS-17.
		- NOTE - Make sure that C++ has been installed for VS-17 as this is a C++ project. 
		
	7.  Inside of the Solution Explorer in VS-17, you will have three projects in the Solution
		'CrossPlatformTutorial'. The only project you need to reference is called 
		'CrossPlatformTutorial (Visual Studio 2017)'. Take some time to explore the project:
			+ Other directories and their files that are not included in CMakeLists.txt 
				are not in the VS-17 project (For example, Build_Instructions/*).
			+ The header files (.h) are located in the External Dependencies folder 
			+ The cpp files (.cpp) are located in the Source Files folder.
			+ Changes made to the .cpp and .h files are updated in the main directory as well. 

	8.	Right click the project name and select 'Set as StartUp Project' from the drop down menu.
		This will tell VS-17 which project needs to be built and ran. The project is now ready
		to be ran! 
		
	9. 	Run the project using the green arrow in the top bar with 'Local Windows Debugger' next to it. 
		The output should be be the executed program: (note - this output may be outdated)
            class A has been created!
            Hey! Class B was made too!
            I'm talking class A!
            Hello! I'm saying Class B!

            This amazingly complex code shall change the world. (Hello World!)
		You can now run and edit the code!
